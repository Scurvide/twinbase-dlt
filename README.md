# Twinbase

Twinbase is an open source platform for managing and distributing [digital twin documents](https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3045856).
It is built on git and can be hosted on free-of-charge GitHub services.

See an example server live at [dtw.twinbase.org](https://dtw.twinbase.org) and details in an open access journal article: Autiosalo, J., Siegel, J., Tammi, K., 2021. Twinbase: Open-Source Server Software for the Digital Twin Web. IEEE Access 9, 140779â€“140798. https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3119487


Twinbase is at __*initial development*__ phase and backwards incompatible changes are expected frequently.
Update mechanisms are not yet implemented.

Twinbase is hosted by Aalto University where its development was initiated as a result of the experience from multiple digital twin related projects.
Twinbase is used as a tool for building the Digital Twin Web introduced in Section III of [this article](https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3045856).
Experiences with Twinbase are used to develop further versions of the [digital twin document standard](https://github.com/AaltoIIC/dt-document).

## Using Twinbase

You can browse the web interface of this Twinbase from the URL shown on the `baseurl` field in the [/docs/index.yaml](/docs/index.yaml) file if this Twinbase is properly configured.

You can fetch twin documents in Python with the [dtweb-python](https://github.com/juusoautiosalo/dtweb-python) library. Available as `dtweb` from pip.

### Creating new twins to your Twinbase

Recommended method to create new twins is to use the new-twin page found on the front page of each Twinbase.

After creating a twin, you need to activate its DT identifier with one of these methods: 
   - To activate the automatically generated dtid.org identifier, send the values of dt-id and hosting-iri of each twin to [this form](https://dtid.org/form).
   - Or you can overwrite the dt-id with the URL given by any [URL shortener service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_shortening#Services) or the [perma-id](https://github.com/perma-id/w3id.org) service. The URL needs to redirect to the hosting-iri.

## To start developing Twinbase

Contribution guidelines are not yet established, but useful contributions are welcome! For development, you can try this:
1. Create your own Twinbase using the Template.
2. Modify your Twinbase as you wish in GitHub.
3. Fork [twinbase/twinbase](https://github.com/twinbase/twinbase). (Do not activate Actions to avoid unnecessary commits.)
4. Manually copy the useful modifications from the repository created with the Template.
5. Submit a pull request.

Local development is a bit tricky as Twinbase uses GitHub Actions as an intergal part of the platform, but feel free to try!

## To create your own Twinbase

1. Create a new repository with the "Use this template" button on the [twinbase/twinbase](https://github.com/twinbase/twinbase) page. (Sign in to GitHub if you can't see the button.)
2. In the newly created repository, activate GitHub Actions from the Actions tab if necessary, and manually run the "File modifier" workflow. (This will modify the files to match your GitHub account. Running the workflow several times will not cause any harm.)
3. Activate GitHub Pages from Settings > Pages > Source to `main` branch and `/docs` folder.
4. A link to the web interface of Twinbase will be shown at the Pages page. If you have not made any domain name customizations, it is in the form *\<username\>.github.io/\<repository name\>*.
5. Updates: Unfortunately any updates from the template repository must currently be made manually. But you can also just make another Twinbase and copy your twin folders and files there.

Forks can be used as well and might make updating easier, but their use has not been properly tested.

## Store hashes of twin documents to an Ethereum distributed ledger (DLT)
Hashes of twin documents (`index.json`) can be stored to a DLT for later verification of the integrity of the document.

Hashes may be stored to a DLT automatically with GitHub Actions. For the Action to work you need to first collect following information related to the DLT used:
- `DLT_TYPE`
  - DLT name, for example `Ethereum Sepolia Testnet`. This is used to sufficiently describe the DLT that is being used.
- `DLT_HTTP_NODE`
  - DLT HTTP endpoint, which can be get from various node providers for free. For example, [Infura](https://www.infura.io/).
- `DLT_PRIVATE_KEY`
  - An [Ethereum account](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/accounts/) (i.e. private key) with some currency for transaction fees.
- `DLT_GAS_PROVIDED`
  - Maximum gas limit that is provided with transactions. The realized gas usage depends on the difficulty of mining the transaction. Current gas market price against ether is calculated in the script. [Gas and fees info](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/).
- `DLT_AUTOMATIC`
  - If the hashes should be stored to DLT automatically on code push or pull requests. Otherwise, the workflow can be run manually from GitHub Actions: `Submit twin document hash to DLT`.

The secrets and variables are set in the repository settings on GitHub under  
 `Settings` > `Secrets and variables` > `Actions`.
   - Set `DLT_PRIVATE_KEY` as `New repository secret`.
   - Set `DLT_HTTP_NODE`, `DLT_TYPE`, `DLT_GAS_PROVIDED` and `DLT_AUTOMATIC` as `Variables` > `New repository variable`.

Examples of the GitHub secrets and variables required:
```
# Repository secrets:
DLT_PRIVATE_KEY=0xaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

# Repository variables:
DLT_TYPE="Ethereum Sepolia Testnet"
DLT_HTTP_NODE=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
DLT_GAS_PROVIDED=100000
DLT_AUTOMATIC=false
```

Once the secrets are set, and the `DLT_AUTOMATIC` variable is set `true`, the hashes are automatically updated to the ledger on code push or pull requests. Only hashes of twin documents that have changed are stored to the DLT.

**Information of the transaction and hash is stored to a `hash-info.json` file within the twin folder.** The value `transactionHash` in this file can be used to discover the transaction within the DLT. The hash found in the DLT transaction as `input` should match the `twinHash` value found in `hash-info.json`.

## Support

There are currently no official support mechanisms for Twinbase, but [Juuso](https://juu.so) may be able to help.

## Thanks

Twinbase uses
- [mini.css](https://minicss.org/) to stylize web pages and 
- [json-view](https://github.com/pgrabovets/json-view) to display digital twin documents.

Thanks to the developers for the nice pieces of software!
